1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
3. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
4. Add `http://localhost:3000` to **Authorized JavaScript origins** and **Authorized redirect URIs**.
5. Download the `credentials.json` file and rename it to `credentials.js`.
6. Update `credentials.js` with your Client ID and API Key:

```javascript
// credentials.js
export const CLIENT_ID = 'your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com';
export const API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
```
7. Add `credentials.js` to Multi-Drive Folder:

## Troubleshooting

### 1. "Unverified App" Warning
- Add your email as a **Test User** in the Google Cloud Console under **OAuth consent screen**.

### 2. Authentication Errors
- Ensure the **Authorized JavaScript origins** and **Authorized redirect URIs** in the Google Cloud Console match `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. CORS Issues
- Use a local server (e.g., `serve`) instead of opening the files directly (`file://` protocol).
